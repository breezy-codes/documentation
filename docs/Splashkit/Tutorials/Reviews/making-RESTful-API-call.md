## Description

This tutorial covers how to create a JSON object and make a RESTful API call using SplashKit. The tutorial goes over using GET resources and POST resources. The tutorial also covers how to handle the response from the API call.

The guide only contained code for C++, this was reviewed and tested by following the tutorial. A fix was made in the C++ code where there was an issue with `to_string`. Then a C# code version and python code version was created and tested to ensure they work correctly and fit into what the C++ code was trying to accomplish. I also included examples of what the outputs should be.
